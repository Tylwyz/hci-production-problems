## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=12K0u0kt2lZPe6e-zfsoYsjiHyX
Your Rationale:  I picked this palette because green represents new beginnings and since this is a new gaming platform I thought it fit.  I also picked it because green is in a lot of other gaming platforms like Microsoft's Xbox and Razer the gaming accessory company.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=50D0u0kvOE5k8NwpCIdBlrZC6kI
Your Rationale: I picked this pallete because when I think of spring I think about flowers and it getting warmer outside, so I decided to stay in the warm color family.  I also made the colors brighter so they represent the color of flowers that people may see on the tour.   

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=33D0G0kEDEDkeKGqLGtEIqfI5jf
Your Rationale: I chose this color palette because I think children usually like things to be more colorful then dull so I made sure to make the colors pop but not so much that it hurts the eyes.  I also picked the palette becuase of the emotions that each color represents with blue being calmness, yellow being happiness, and the red orange to represent energy so that children hopefully pick up on.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=13K190kvwrX35VZpSvWzalKpP2j
Your Rationale: I picked this color pallete becuase blue represents security and I wanted to make sure that what and black were in there.  The reason for white was is to show that being in cybersecurity is a virtue since you would be protecting people and black is to represent the mysterious and possible evil people you are protecting clients from.
